# Smart-Contract-For-A-Multi-Sig-Wallet
# MultiSig Contract

This repository contains a Solidity contract for a multi-signature (multisig) wallet, implemented using the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows a predefined set of owners to collectively manage and approve transactions.

## Contract Details

The `MultiSig` contract is a multisig wallet that requires a specified number of owners to approve a transaction before it can be executed. Here are the main components of the contract:

### Owners and Required Signatures

- `owners`: An array of Ethereum addresses representing the owners of the multisig wallet. These addresses have the authority to confirm and execute transactions.
- `required`: The minimum number of owner signatures required to approve a transaction.

### Transactions

- `transactions`: An array that stores the details of submitted transactions, including the destination address, value, execution status, and additional data.
- `Transaction` struct: Defines the structure of a transaction, containing the destination address (`_dest`), value (`_value`), execution status (`executed`), and additional data (`data`).

### Functions

- `addTransaction`: Internal function used to create and add a new transaction to the `transactions` array.
- `transactionCount`: Public function that returns the total number of submitted transactions.
- `confirmTransaction`: Public function for owners to confirm a specific transaction by providing its ID.
- `getConfirmationsCount`: Public function that returns the number of confirmations received for a given transaction.
- `submitTransaction`: External function for submitting a new transaction, automatically confirming and executing it.
- `receive`: Fallback function that allows the contract to receive Ether.
- `isConfirmed`: Public function that checks if a transaction has received the required number of confirmations.
- `executeTransaction`: Public function used to execute a confirmed transaction.

## Getting Started

To use this contract, you need to deploy it on the Ethereum blockchain. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Install and set up the required development environment, including Solidity and the Ethereum client of your choice.
2. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
3. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network of your choice, specifying the initial set of owners and the required number of signatures.
4. Interact with the deployed contract by calling its functions, such as `submitTransaction` to create and execute transactions, or `confirmTransaction` to provide owner approvals.

Please note that deploying and interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain require familiarity with blockchain development and associated tools.
